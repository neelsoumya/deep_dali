# deep_dali_waves

## Introduction

Computational art using empathetic Artificial Intelligence and dynamical systems.
This can be used to understand life as we do `not` know it.

This repository has outreach and recreational mathematics activities for lay people to understand alternate views of life (life as we do `not` know it).

## Installation

The Python programming language can be installed from 

	https://www.python.org/downloads/

Clone or download the repository.

```r
git clone https://github.com/neelsoumya/deep_dali
```

The dependencies can then be installed by typing the following at the command line:

```r
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The NetLOGO language can then be installed from

	https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml

Alternatively a version of NetLOGO that can be run from the web browser is available here:

	http://netlogoweb.org/


## Usage


Type the following command at the command line:

```r
python3 deep_dream.py deepdali.jpg result
```

A modified `dreaming` picture will be saved as result.jpg

The image has a dream-like quality and emphasizes the beauty in life and in dynamical systems.
